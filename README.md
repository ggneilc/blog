# Goal

The goal here is to create a website that I can play with and am able to put information out there, specifically my obsidian notes & self:
 - Personal : Resume, email, social links
 - Vault : Obsidian notes & fundamentally a blog
 - Projects : talk about some of the projects and link appropriate githubs


# Design Goal

Ideally there should be a landing page, which can act as a sandbox for implementing creative website design, because that should catch the viewers attention. 

After that I want each page to be *simple*, because all I really want is to be getting my info out there. I want this blog to reflect poking around my obsidian, therefore the blogs will be under one large 'moc', and 'dataview' is listing out all the posts.

The goal for today is to try and build the blog piece, because I don't want anything fancy, it should be simple. From there I can grow the site to include the landing page, resume, projects, etc. 

**We want a window into our obsidian vault!**

### Design thought for Blog page

- In order to achieve the center justified look, I can use a css grid to keep elements in the center, or I could use a flexbox that is placed in the center.
